<h3>About Kashaya</h3>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashaya_language">Kashaya</a> is a Native American language spoken in Sonoma County, along the Pacific coast in northern California; it is one of seven languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomoan_languages">Pomoan</a> family. It is the language of the <a href="http://stewartspoint.org/">Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria</a>.</p>
<p>The sound files provided on this website are intended as a guide to the pronunciation of Kashaya sounds and vocabulary, for the use of tribal members and others interested in learning about the language. Its design was overseen by <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~gene/home.html">Gene Buckley</a> of the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania; the programming work began in the fall of 2020 and was done by <a href="https://www.jhtomlee.com">Tom (Jonghyun) Lee</a>, at that time a student in the Master's in Computer Science program, who continues to help with the development and maintenance of the site.</p>
<p>Buckley previously assembled  resources about Kashaya in <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~gene/kashaya.html">another location,</a> including an earlier version of these sound files, but the eventual goal is to integrate them into this website.</p>
<h4>The sound files</h4>
<p>The recordings from which these audio clips have been extracted were collected over a period of six decades, with generous collaboration by many speakers of Kashaya. The recordings are from several phases. The first phase (1957-1958, plus 1964) began when Robert Oswalt was a graduate student in linguistics at UC Berkeley. Among the many important documents from Oswalt's long study of the language are a grammar (his 1961 dissertation), a large collection of texts (published 1964), and an extensive draft of a dictionary (2005) which forms the basis of an <a href="https://www.webonary.org/kashaya/">online dictionary</a> developed by Buckley.</p>
<p>Much of the audio presented on this website comes from the Oswalt recordings, now housed at the <a href="https://cla.berkeley.edu">California Language Archive</a> (CLA) in Berkeley. They represent the voices and knowledge most notably of Essie Parrish, the Kashaya spiritual leader and Oswalt's main consultant. Nearly all the narratives among these recordings are spoken by Essie Parrish and Herman James, but also include material from Violet Chapelle (daughter of Essie) and Glady James (daughter of Herman). Narratives not published in the 1964 volume apparently include the voices of Ethel Lucas and Louise Smith, but they have not yet been examined for use on this website.</p>
<p>Some words and phrases have been extracted from these narratives, but it can be difficult to do this in a way that is useful for the study of isolated words – they are more easily extracted from sessions in which the speaker pronounces them separately. The Oswalt recordings include such sessions with Essie Parrish, Violet Chapelle, and Isabelle Johnson (sister of Essie).</p>
<p>The second phase of recordings comes from a field methods class at UC Berkeley in 1989-1990, and present the voice of Milton &quot;Bun&quot; Lucas (son of Ethel), who was the language consultant in a field methods course led by Leanne Hinton. This is where Buckley first became familiar with Kashaya, and it led to his 1992 dissertation about the language. A number of audio clips have been extracted from these recordings, which (like Oswalt's) are housed at the CLA.</p>
<p>The third phase begins in 2009, with another field methods class at UC Berkeley, this time led by Pam Munro. It was part of the biannual Linguistic Institute of the <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/lsas-linguistic-institutes">LSA</a> that occurs every two years at a different university; those recordings are also at the CLA. The consultant in this class was Anita Silva (daughter of Isabelle Johnson).</p>
<p>A few years later, Buckley received a grant from the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/grants/preservation/documenting-endangered-languages">Documenting Endangered Languages</a> program, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, which made it possible for him to work with Anita Silva multiple times over the period 2012 to 2015. A few of the audio clips here come from these recordings, but many more remain to be extracted.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Buckley was able to record the speech of several other speakers in 2017 and 2018: Otis Parrish (son of Essie), Inez Adam, and Freda Davis. These are relatively few in number but represent the most recent recordings to be found on this website. Some of that work was funded by the <a href="https://research.upenn.edu/funding/university-research-foundation/">University Research Foundation</a>.</p>
